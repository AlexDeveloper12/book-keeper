# book-keeper
The purpose of the application is to allow me to keep track of the books I am reading at the moment so I do not have to crinkle the pages of my books and buy a plethora
of bookmarkers. In addition, writing this app has allowed me to gain a lot more experience and knowledge in various areas of React-Native including the use of
Hooks, Helper functions, authentication & authorization using JWT, in addition, implementing nested-navigators using React-Navigation. (Some folders have been
